# Search and Rescue TurtleBot â€“ Navigation System Design & Simulation (MATLAB)
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a navigation system for a TurtleBot mobile robot applied in search and rescue operations within disaster-stricken areas. The goal is to enable the robot to autonomously navigate from point A to point B while effectively avoiding obstacles and responding to environmental challenges using MATLAB.

# Project Objectives:
- Simulate a realistic search and rescue scenario using MATLAB and a TurtleBot model.
- Implement and evaluate path planning, motion control, and obstacle avoidance strategies.
- Integrate simulated sensor perception (LiDAR, camera) for mapping and localization.
- Address safety, robustness, and ethical aspects of deploying autonomous robots in high-risk environments.

# Key Focus Areas:
- Kinematics and Dynamics of Wheeled Mobile Robots
- Path Planning & Trajectory Generation (e.g., A*, RRT)
- Motion Control (PID, velocity commands)
- Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
- Localization and Mapping (SLAM concepts)
- Simulation using MATLAB Robotics Toolbox

# Tools & Technologies:
- MATLAB R2023+
- Robotics System Toolbox
- TurtleBot Simulation Model
- Sensor Simulation (Lidar, Ultrasonic, RGBD)

# Outcome:
A fully simulated rescue robot capable of navigating autonomously in cluttered, dynamic environments, laying the foundation for future real-world implementation in emergency response scenarios.
